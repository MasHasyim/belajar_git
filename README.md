## What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control. Git simplifies the process of working with other people and makes it easy to collaborate on projects. Team members can work on files and easily merge their changes in with the master branch of the project.

## What is a Repository?
A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.

## What is a Branch?
A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The default branch is called master. You can use branches to safely conduct experiments, isolate work, and make changes without affecting the main codebase.

## What is a Pull Request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

## What is a Merge Conflict?
A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help. However, when two commits modify the same line of a file, Git isn't able to automatically determine which change should be used.

## What is a Fork?
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## What is a Clone?
A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online.

## What is a Commit?
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.

## What is a Push?
Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.

## What is a Pull?
Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

## What is a Remote?
This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.
